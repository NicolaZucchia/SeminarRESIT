- nonlinear_exp_scenario2.py : experiment with 2,3,4 variables and exponential relationships as explained in Scenario 2 (results may vary based on iteration)

- nonlinear_exp_100times.py : same experiment as nonlinearUnif100.py repeated 100 times

- nonlinear_sine_100times.py : sine nonlinearities

- nonlinearDebugPro.py : exponential nonlinearities, full debug (scenario 2)
Note: running again may yield different results every time

- nonlinearGLM.py : uses GLM instead of Gaussian Process for exponential nonlinearities

- nonlinearGLM.py : nonlinearGLM.py run 100 times
